This is a project made to get info about the IP change rates, how long the ISPÂ´s mantain the IPs assigned and if they have any regards for GeoLocation providers ( not assigning completely remote IPs to other regions)

## ðŸ”§ Tools
This project is a WIP so this list may be expanded, but to this day I have worked with

 - WebStorm
 - Ionic
 - React
 - Axios
 - IPInfo API
 - Prisma DB
 - Prisma Studio

## ðŸŽ¨ Features
  - Continous running
  - Prisma implementation for easy DB switching and migration
  - Low performance impact
  - Very stable, can be left running for longs periods
  
## Setup

There is an additional part for setup which is [IP_History_web](https://github.com/Meganitrospeed/ip_history_web) which is a GUI made in Ionic+React for the easy visualisation of the recollected data

Steps:
 - Get an API Token from ipinfo.io
 - Ensure you have installed: NodeJS and a working Postgre server
 - Add the token in app.js in line 33
 - Add the DB credentials in prisma/schema.prisma
 - Run npm instal and npm prisma migrate
 - Run the project!
 
 Suggestions: If you want to run this to recollect data/in a production environment, pair it with something like [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/)
